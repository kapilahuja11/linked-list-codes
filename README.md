# Linked-List 
This repository contains my solutions for common graph data structure problems and implementation of Data Structures in Cpp.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.   

## Problems:

1. Add two numbers represented by linked list
2. Delete Duplicate in Sorted linked list
3. Delete without head pointer
4. Detect Loop in linked list
5. Find length of Loop
6. Given a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s, sort it
7. Insert in a Sorted List
8. Merge two sorted linked list
9. Remove duplicate element from sorted Linked List
10. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
11. Remove loop in Linked List 
12. Rotate a Linked List
13. Check linked list is even or odd
14. Check two identical linked list or not
15. Checking parenthese
16. circular linked list
17. copy one liked list into another
18. Delete duplicate
19. Delete element in unsorted list
20. Delete alternate postion node in linked list
21. Find middle element
22. Find nth node from end
23. Implemention of stack using linked list
24. Insert into sorted linked list
25. Insert node into middle in linked list
26. Intersection of two linked list
27. Level Order Travesal
28. palidrome linked list
29. Reverse in pair linkedlist
30. Print linked list in reverse order
31. Reverse linked list and print data without recursion
32. Reverse merge sorted linked list
33. Reverse linked list using recursion
34. Segregate linked list into even and odd
35. Sum of last nth nodes in linked list
36. Swapping node in linked list
